      It is shocking to study the analysis of the National Milk Quality Survey conducted by FSSAI in 2018, India's food regulator which clearly states that appox. 70% of milk is found to be contaminated with pollutants. If we go by this report, then every next shop and vendor we approach to buy our sweets and daily dairy products is adulterated with plastic and unsafe for consumption. The same has been quoted by surveys & even in the Lok Sabha debates by Union Minister for Science and Technology - Harsh Vardhan in 2016. <br/>

      Why the gap does exist? <br/>
      Milk is an important and most commonly used commodity in our Indian household categorized as essential foods. This leads to an increased demand for milk amongst all age groups products. Also, milk is a sole such ingredient which is used in almost all sweets, thus leading to a whole new level of demand especially during the festival season, resulting in an uncontrolled adulteration. As milk and milk products constitute a huge market in the Indian setup, contamination is bound to happen since this is a shortcut for the manufacturers to make money by cutting production & manufacturing costs and ultimately, leading to great profit margins. <br/>

      What is the gap? <br/>
      As per the survey, there are many cheap resources that are easily available to contaminate and thicken the consistency of the milk to make it last for long durations. As per the survey,
      Out of all non-compliant samples, the highest contributor attributing to almost 46 percent is the category of low Solid Not Fat (SNF). The prime reason is the dilution of milk with water.
      Another 8 percent was found to have been laced with detergent, caustic soda, and paint. <br/>
      Out of the total 548 samples, 87 milk wasn't fit for use & contained glucose. <br/>

      How can it affect us? <br/>
      Since milk is the first thing consumed by a new-born, we all know the importance of milk in our daily life. Consuming an unfit dosage of milk can blight the functioning of various organs in the human body, causing severe heart problems, cancerous tissues, and in extreme cases, even death. <br/>

      As per the recent advisory issued by the World Health Organization, if the rate of adulteration isn't monitored and controlled, a large portion of India's population would succumb to serious and fatal diseases by the end of 2025.

  title: 'Test Your Milk',
  subtitle: '68% of the dairy products in India are not as per the standards prescribed by FSSAI.',

      Milk Adulteration is a known problem, yet many of us do not pay attention and continue trusting our source of milk. Many organizations including Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) have raised alarms on the milk adulteration problem in India and itâ€™s harmful effects, but not enough measures are being taken. In 2018, it was reported that about 68% of the dairy products in India are not as per the standards prescribed by FSSAI.  Detergent, caustic soda, glucose, white paint, and refined oil are few of the most common adulterants found in dairy. <br />
      As part of our mission, Honest Milk is working to create awareness about the milk adulteration problem. Our team has conducted many seminars and workshops educating local communities about the problem and sharing simple techniques to test milk purity. Our quality team is working to create  inexpensive home testing-kits so that every household can test the purity of milk they are consuming.  <br />
      No matter what your source is, we strongly recommend regular milk testing. Now the question is where to get it tested?  Well, here is what we recommend:
      <ol>
        <li>Search FSSAI approved food labs in your area: You should be able to find many FSSAI approved food testing labs in your area. If they are not FSSAI approved, ask them the test techniques they are using and if it is based on FSSAI techniques.</li>
