  title: 'Milk Adulteration in India',
  subtitle: 'Urea, Formalin, Detergents, Ammonium Sulfate, Boric Acid, Caustic Soda, Benzoic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Hydrogen peroxide, Sugars, and Melamine.',

      It is shocking to study the analysis of the National Milk Quality Survey conducted by FSSAI in 2018, India's food regulator which clearly states that appox. 70% of milk is found to be contaminated with pollutants. If we go by this report, then every next shop and vendor we approach to buy our sweets and daily dairy products is adulterated with plastic and unsafe for consumption. The same has been quoted by surveys & even in the Lok Sabha debates by Union Minister for Science and Technology - Harsh Vardhan in 2016. <br/>

      Why the gap does exist? <br/>
      Milk is an important and most commonly used commodity in our Indian household categorized as essential foods. This leads to an increased demand for milk amongst all age groups products. Also, milk is a sole such ingredient which is used in almost all sweets, thus leading to a whole new level of demand especially during the festival season, resulting in an uncontrolled adulteration. As milk and milk products constitute a huge market in the Indian setup, contamination is bound to happen since this is a shortcut for the manufacturers to make money by cutting production & manufacturing costs and ultimately, leading to great profit margins. <br/>

      What is the gap? <br/>
      As per the survey, there are many cheap resources that are easily available to contaminate and thicken the consistency of the milk to make it last for long durations. As per the survey,
      Out of all non-compliant samples, the highest contributor attributing to almost 46 percent is the category of low Solid Not Fat (SNF). The prime reason is the dilution of milk with water.
      Another 8 percent was found to have been laced with detergent, caustic soda, and paint. <br/>
      Out of the total 548 samples, 87 milk wasn't fit for use & contained glucose. <br/>

      How can it affect us? <br/>
      Since milk is the first thing consumed by a new-born, we all know the importance of milk in our daily life. Consuming an unfit dosage of milk can blight the functioning of various organs in the human body, causing severe heart problems, cancerous tissues, and in extreme cases, even death. <br/>

      As per the recent advisory issued by the World Health Organization, if the rate of adulteration isn't monitored and controlled, a large portion of India's population would succumb to serious and fatal diseases by the end of 2025.
