            Our Milk comes from the co-managed farms that are managed by highly trained and experienced dairy farmers. Each partnered farm goes through rigorous training and follows the standard procedures that are prepared by team of dairy experts, veterinarians and nutrionists  giving utmost priority to animal health and nutrition. Cattle health is regularly monitored and each animal goes through routine check-up before milking, because only healthy cows give healthy MILK!

            Many of our customers wanted to know why they receive chilled milk. Well, this is to ensure that quality can be maintained without adding any preservatives. Raw Milk is chilled to 2 degree Celsius to prevent the microbial growth and is packaged right after in our eco-friendly and non-toxic glass bottles to retain temperature.
